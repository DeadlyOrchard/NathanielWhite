          <p class="article-par">I attended MSU for two and a half years. Most of that time was spent on a music education degree with tuba as my primary instrument. While I didn't finish the degree, most of my first two years were spent on music courses, rather than general education requirements (ask my advisor, I still don't know why). In those courses, I learned how to play trumpet, french horn, baritone, and piano as well as how to use music theory to play sheet music more effectively. In summer 2021, I traveled to over ten states performing the Troopers Drum and Bugle Corps.</p>
          <p class="article-par">After the revelation that performing arts are not for me (performance anxiety), I changed to a bachelor's in computer science. My time at this university post major change was short lived due to all the challenges that Covid brought to the school. By fall of 2022, I moved on to Southern New Hampshire University.</p>
          <p class="article-par">I have many great memories from this institution. Playing in massive performance halls, hearing the most inspiring melodies. Truly, words do not suffice. I think this <a href="***">video</a> speaks for itself.</p>

            <li>A few days ago, a peer of mine, <a href="***">Luke</a> implemented their own in Golang using the terminal. So, I thought I'd have a go at it.</li>

            <li>After seeing a 3Blue1Brown (YouTube) video on the discrete fourier transform, I wanted to implmement it myself.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>I followed a CodingTrain (YouTube) video where he implemented a drawing machine in javascript using the algorithm.</li>
              <li>I didn't want it to be too easy though, so I opted to use C++ and SDL2, much lower-level than javascript.</li>
              <li>I started this project in May 2023, but I touched it up just slightly recently. These were the changes:</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul class="article-ls">
            <li>Build system (CMake)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Removed pointer arithmetic, switched to pass by reference</li>
              <li>Removed unnecessary params in FourierSeries constructor</li>
              <li>Made curly braces consistent</li>

            <li>I made the source.txt file using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, a free 3d animation software. Here are steps I took to make it:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Found a suitable image, then traced out the path to be drawn.</li>
              <li>Assigned an object to follow the path. </li>
              <li>Wrote a short python script to use the Blender API to step through each frame and write the object's position to a file.</li>

            <li>While the project uses <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2">SDL2</a>, no downloads are necessary. Instead, CMake will fetch the SDL2 package for you.</li>
